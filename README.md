# Introduction

This Car showroom management system is designed for such owners and users who are interested in cars. This system keeps track of all the cars along with their each and every single detail. From the car models to up to what transactions can one negotiate while taking that car, one can view all the data here. If someone is interested in buying the car, then he/she can contact the retailer as well for the same, via the system.

Our project car showroom management system includes managing the details of cars,  customers, 
employees and storing the details into the system in a computerized way.

The modern industrial world is very much advanced in technology and the competition in the 
world is intense.
The management system has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the piratical 
manual system .

This project is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardships faced by the  
existing system. Moreover this management system is designed for the particular need to carry 
out operations in a smooth and effective manner. This  kind of system reduces as much as 
possible type of errors while inserting some data. Every organization , whether big organization or
small organization has challenged to overcome all the loop holes of its management system.
